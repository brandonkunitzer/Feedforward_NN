# Feedforward Neural Network
## Neural Network used to predict fantasy football outcomes

Have you ever wanted the edge in a fantasy football match? I did, that's why I set forth on the journey of making this project. The goal of this project was to use a neural network to help predict whether or not a fantasy football player will outperform their fantasy football projections or not. However, I decided to challenge myself a little bit more and developed the neural network myself. I developed a feedforward neural network that uses a sigmoid activation to classify whether or not a player is going to outperform their projection. With this project I included:

* Code for the neural network
* The data I used to train the model
* A saved version of the model and scaler for data

# Technical
This neural network takes in four inputs and has a single hidden layer with 4 neurons.
